# Hard-coded visible-string audit

Regenerate with `python tool/audit_report.py` from `easyrepair_app/`.

Every literal that `tool/extract_ui_strings.py` finds in a user-visible position is classified into exactly one category.

| Category | Meaning | Count |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dynamic / user / backend content that must remain unchanged | 50 |
| 2 | Protected bottom-navigation English | 9 |
| 3 | Internal technical value, or a fixed name no language changes | 231 |
| 4 | **Missed app-owned visible text that must be localized** | **0** |
| 5 | Approved English-only legal document content awaiting professional translation | 64 |

> Audit passes: no app-owned visible string remains hard-coded.

Category 5 is a product and legal decision, not missed work. The Privacy Policy and Terms bodies stay in their approved English wording until a professionally approved Urdu and Roman Urdu translation exists; the app chrome around them, including the notice that says the document is English only, *is* localized. See `legal_translation_exclusions.md`.
